      <description>I was thinking lately about conferences and it reminded me of two which hold fond memories for me: my first KubeCon/CloudnativeCon and my first Helm summit. As I reminisced, I realized then that these two conferences struck a cord with me because of my journey starting out with Helm 3 at KubeCon/CloudnativeCon NA 2018 (Seattle) and the release nearing completion at the Helm summit 2019 (Amsterdam). Helm 3 was released in time for KubeCon/CloudnativeCon NA 2019 and it made me wonder how things evolved in such a relative short space of time.</description>

      <description>Helm v3 is one of the most eagerly anticipated releases for the last year or so. The good news is that it now available.
The excitement for this release has been heightened by the longing for the removal of Tiller. It would however be of a limited view to think that &amp;ldquo;no more Tiller&amp;rdquo; is the extent of the release. Helm v3 has also introduced a rich set of new capabilities.</description>
